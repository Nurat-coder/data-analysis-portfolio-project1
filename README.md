# Retail Store Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis aims to provide insights into the revenue trends, product performance, customer behavior and sales channels of a retail store over the past 3 years. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data driven recommendations and gain deeper understanding of the stores performance.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is "retail_store_sales.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the store

### Tools

- Excel- Data Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization
- MsWord- Creating report [click here to download the report](Retail_Store_Sales_Report.pdf)

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase we performed the following task:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handing missing data
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

The EDA involved exploring the store's sales data to answer key stakeholder questions:

- What is the total revenue generated?
- Which product category has the highest number of sales?
- Which branch generated the most revenue?
- How do monthly sales trend over time?
- What are the top 5 selling products by quantity and revenue?
- Which day of the week has the most sales?
- What is the distribution of payment methods used?

### Data Analysis

These are some of the interesting features used Excel to perform the analysis

1. Used Excel’s date functions and pivot tables to uncover seasonal trends and monthly peaks.  
2. Compared revenue between Online and In-Store branches using slicers and pivot charts.  
3. Created dynamic pivot tables to rank categories and individual products by both revenue and quantity.  
4. Built a fully interactive dashboard with:
   - KPIs
   - Bar & Line Charts
   - Donut charts for Payment Method Distribution
   - Slicers for filtering by branch, category, or month
5. Utilized ranked pivot filters to highlight top-performing products.  
6. Used Excel’s weekday functions to analyze trends by day of the week.  
7. Applied logical formulas (`IF`, `ISBLANK`, custom calculations) to handle:
  - Missing price per unit data
  - Blank product names
  - Mis-formatted dates
