# 🛒 Retail Store Sales Analysis Dashboard
# 🚀 Project Overview
As part of my growing journey into data analysis, I took on the challenge of transforming raw sales data into valuable business insights using nothing but Microsoft Excel. This project simulates a real-world scenario where a retail company needs help understanding performance across multiple product categories, channels, and time periods.
My goal? Use Excel to deliver clarity, storytelling, and strategy.

## 📌The Challenge
The retail business was sitting on a pile of transaction records but lacked direction. Key business questions they needed answers to:
1. What is the total revenue generated?
2. Which product category has the highest sales?
3. Which branch contributes the most revenue?
4. How do monthly sales trend over time?
5. What are the top-selling products by quantity and revenue?
6. Which day has the highest sales?
7. What payment methods are most commonly used?

- The company should enhance its Online Sales Channel. Improving user experience and offering exclusive discounts should be its priority.
- Noting that the Peak Sales days are around the weekends, the company should plan bonuses and discount sales around Fridays and weekends.
